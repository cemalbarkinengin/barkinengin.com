As a part of Karen Willemsâ€™ tape releases, I have the pleasure to collaborate with her once again. The result is titled Seslerde; which is kind of a sonic journey of the days we spent performing together in Istanbul back in February. My dear friends Zeynep Kaya Beraud and Burak Tamer are also guests on the record. The tape will be released by WERF Records based in Bruges.
